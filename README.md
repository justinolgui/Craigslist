# Craigslist
 The purpose of this project is to analyse pricing for items sold on Craiglist

My goal is to create a script to be able to aggregate prices for items that I plan to sell on Craiglist. The goal is to identify pricing trends for items that I plan on listing to optimize my selling price while minimizing the amount of time it takes to sell my item. Updates to follow.
